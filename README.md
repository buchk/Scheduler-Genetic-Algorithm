# Scheduler-Genetic-Algorithm
A genetic algorithm to create the best possible schedule of classes in a computer science department. 
Works best with a population around 500, the max generations doesn't matter that much, it just depends how precise you want the result to
be, crossover percentage of .75, and mutation percentage of .1.
